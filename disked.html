            <p>so, what is disked you may ask?</p>
            <p>disked is a nas manager / interface for linux with support for 4 disks.</p>
            <p>it is a hobby project im making for <a href="https://flavortown.hackclub.com/">flavortown</a></p>
            <p>currently, it is in a very early state and buggy</p>
            <p>you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/angrypig555/disked">github</a> and build it with cmake.</p>
            <p>it is written in c++</p>
            <p>dependencies if you actually want to build it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>gcc or your favourite c compiler</li>
                <li>cmake</li>
                <li>a linux machine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>but how much features are actually in it?</p>
            <p>currently, there is support to mount the disks, partition them and format them</p>
